# Stellar AgentKit 🌟

Stellar AgentKit is an open-source SDK and platform for interacting with the Stellar blockchain,
providing a unified agent to perform complex DeFi operations such as swaps, bridges, and liquidity
pool (LP) actions.

Built for both developers and end users, AgentKit simplifies Stellar-based DeFi by consolidating
multiple operations into a single programmable and extensible toolkit.

## 🧠 What is AgentKit?

AgentKit abstracts complex Stellar operations into a **single agent interface** that can be:

- Embedded by developers into dApps
